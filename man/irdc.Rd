\title{Estimate the Integrated R-squared Dependence Coefficient (irdc)}
\usage{
irdc(Y, X, dist.type.X = "continuous", na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A vector of length n.}

\item{X}{A vector or matrix of length n (or with n rows).}

\item{dist.type.X}{A string specifying the distribution type of X: either "continuous" or "discrete". Default is "continuous".}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; if TRUE, missing values (NAs) will be removed. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
The Integrated R-squared Dependence Coefficient (irdc) between Y and X.
}
\description{
The Integrated R-squared Dependence Coefficient (irdc) is a measure of dependence between
a random variable Y and a random vector X, based on an i.i.d. sample of (Y, X).
The estimated coefficient is asymptotically guaranteed to lie between 0 and 1.
The measure is asymmetrical; that is, irdc(X, Y) â‰  irdc(Y, X).
The measure equals 0 if and only if X is independent of Y, and it equals 1 if and only if
Y is a measurable function of X.
This coefficient has several applications; for example, it can be used for variable selection, as demonstrated in the \code{\link{ford}} function.
}
\details{
The value returned by `irdc` can be positive or negative for finite samples,
but asymptotically, it is guaranteed to be between 0 and 1.
A small value indicates low dependence between Y and X, while a high value indicates strong dependence.
The `irdc` function is used by the \code{\link{ford}} function for variable selection.

\examples{
n = 1000
x <- matrix(runif(n * 3), nrow = n)
y <- (x[, 1] + x[, 2])
irdc(y, x[, 1])
irdc(y, x[, 2])
irdc(y, x[, 3])
